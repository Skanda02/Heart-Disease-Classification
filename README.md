## The Approach we will be following :

|--- 1. Problem definition
|--- 2. Data
|--- 3. Evaluation
|--- 4. Features
|--- 5. Modelling
|--- 6. Experimentation

---

## 1. Problem Definition
"Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?"

---

## 2. Data
The original data came from the **Cleveland dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
[UCI Repository Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)  

There is also a version of it available on **Kaggle**:

## 3. Evaluation
Since this is related to the **health sector**, we need **high accuracy**.  
If we achieve **95% accuracy**, we will consider the effort worth it (maybe or maybe not).

---

## 4. Features
1. **age** - age in years  

2. **sex** - (1 = male; 0 = female)  

3. **cp** - chest pain type  
   - 0: Typical angina → chest pain related to decreased blood supply to the heart  
   - 1: Atypical angina → chest pain not related to the heart  
   - 2: Non-anginal pain → typically esophageal spasms (non-heart related)  
   - 3: Asymptomatic → chest pain not showing signs of disease  

4. **trestbps** - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)  
   - Anything above 130–140 is typically cause for concern  

5. **chol** - serum cholesterol in mg/dl  
   - serum = LDL + HDL + 0.2 * triglycerides  
   - Above 200 is cause for concern  

6. **fbs** - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)  
   - '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes  

7. **restecg** - resting electrocardiographic results  
   - 0: Nothing to note  
   - 1: ST-T Wave abnormality  
     - Can range from mild symptoms to severe problems  
     - Signals non-normal heartbeat  
   - 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy  
     - Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber  

8. **thalach** - maximum heart rate achieved  

9. **exang** - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)  

10. **oldpeak** - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest  
    - Looks at stress of heart during exercise  
    - Unhealthy heart will stress more  

11. **slope** - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment  
    - 0: Upsloping → better heart rate with exercise (uncommon)  
    - 1: Flatsloping → minimal change (typical healthy heart)  
    - 2: Downsloping → signs of unhealthy heart  

12. **ca** - number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy  
    - Colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through  
    - The more blood movement, the better (no clots)  

13. **thal** - thalium stress result  
    - 1, 3: Normal  
    - 6: Fixed defect → used to be defect but okay now  
    - 7: Reversible defect → no proper blood movement when exercising  

14. **target** - whether the patient has disease or not  
    - 1 = Yes  
    - 0 = No  
    - *(Predicted attribute)*
